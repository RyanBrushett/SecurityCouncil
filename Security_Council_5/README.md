# Security Council
==================

## Fri. Jan 24:
* Added feature branch for admin dashboard
* Added a db.js with empty arrays for users and rooms. Not sure we'll need it, at least not yet, but it won't kill us to have it there.
* I need to comment stuff.
* Created the framework for using the page
* Doesn't do a lot at the moment but it's somewhere to start from.

### Look in:
/public/js

/routes/scadmin.js

/views/sc-admin.hjs
