# Security Council
==================

## Mon. Jan 27
* Added AJAX file and functions to change Admin Dashboard UI using AJAX requests. Might be handy.
* Talked to Dan about this. Dan is starting User Management. Ryan will do the Room/Sim creation.
* Little "database" is functional as per commits earlier the weekend.

## Fri. Jan 24:
* Added feature branch for admin dashboard
* Added a db.js with arrays for users and rooms. Not sure we'll need it, at least not yet, but it won't kill us to have it there.
* I need to comment stuff pretty badly.
* Created the framework for using the page
* Doesn't do a lot at the moment but it's somewhere to start from.
* Tested out Hogan and it's compiling and all that.
* Best bet is to run node app.js and visit http://localhost:3000/sc-admin I have some info on that page.

### Look in:
views/sc-admin.hjs

public/js/adminFunctions.js (this is definitely going out the window but it's a good example)

db.js

routes/scadmin.js (this one shows Hogan in action a little bit)
