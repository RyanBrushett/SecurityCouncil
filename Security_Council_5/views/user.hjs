					<p><em>The Security Council</em>,</p>
					<p><em>Welcoming</em> the report of the Secretary-General of 30 December 2013 (S/2013/781) on the United Nations operation in Cyprus,</p>
					<p><em>Noting</em> that the Government of Cyprus is agreed that in view of the prevailing conditions on the island it is necessary to keep the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) beyond 31 January 2014,</p>
					<p><em>Noting</em> the intention of the Secretary-General to report on his Good Offices in the next reporting period, and echoing the Secretary-General&rsquo;s firm belief that the responsibility for finding a solution lies first and foremost with the Cypriots themselves, and reaffirming the primary role of the United Nations in assisting the parties to bring the Cyprus conflict and division of the island to a comprehensive and durable settlement,</p>
					<p><em>Acknowledging</em> the efforts made so far to restart talks, expressing disappointment that formal negotiations have not yet resumed, and calling on the parties to agree on a substantive way forward as soon as possible,</p>
					<p><em>Recalling</em> the importance attached by the international community to all parties engaging fully, flexibly and constructively in the negotiations, and noting that the move towards a more intensive phase of negotiations has not yet resulted in an enduring, comprehensive and just settlement based on a bicommunal, bizonal federation with political equality, as set out in the relevant Security Council resolutions, encouraging the sides to resume the substantive negotiations on the core issues, and stressing that the status quo is unsustainable,</p>
					<p><em>Welcoming</em> the efforts of the Secretary-General to stimulate progress during his meeting with the two leaders on 31 October 2011 and 23 January 2012, and expressing continued support for his efforts,</p>
					<p><em>Noting</em> the need to advance the consideration of and discussions on military confidence-building measures, calling for renewed efforts to implement all remaining confidence-building measures, and for agreement on and implementation of further steps to build trust between the communities,</p>
					<p><em>Reaffirming</em> the importance of continued crossings of the Green Line by Cypriots, and encouraging the opening by mutual agreement of other crossing points,</p>
					<p><em>Convinced</em> of the many important benefits, including economic benefits, for all Cypriots that would flow from a comprehensive and durable Cyprus settlement, urging the two sides and their leaders to foster positive public rhetoric, and encouraging them clearly to explain the benefits of the settlement, as well as the need for increased flexibility and compromise in order to secure it, to both communities well in advance of any eventual referenda,</p>
					<p><em>Considering</em> that undermining the United Nations&rsquo; credibility undermines the peace process itself,</p>
					<p><em>Highlighting</em> the importance of the supporting role of the international community, and in particular that of the parties concerned in taking practical steps towards helping the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leaders to exploit fully the current opportunity,</p>
					<p><em>Taking note</em> of the assessment of the Secretary-General that the security situation on the island and along the Green Line remains stable, and urging all sides to avoid any action which could lead to an increase in tension, undermine the progress achieved so far, or damage the goodwill on the island,</p>
					<p><em>Recalling</em> the Secretary-General’s firm belief that the situation in the buffer zone would be improved if both sides accepted the 1989 aide-memoire used by the United Nations,</p>
					<p><em>Noting</em> with regret that the sides are withholding access to the remaining minefields in the buffer zone, and that demining in Cyprus must continue, noting the continued danger posed by mines in Cyprus, and urging rapid agreement on facilitating the recommencement of demining operations and clearance of the remaining minefields,</p>
					<p><em>Highlighting</em> the importance of the activities of the Committee on Missing Persons, urging the opening up of access to all areas to allow the Committee to carry out their work, and trusting that this process will promote reconciliation between the communities,</p>
					<p><em>Agreeing</em> that active participation of civil society groups, including women’s groups, is essential to the political process and can contribute to making any future settlement sustainable, recalling that women play a critically important role in peace processes, welcoming all efforts to promote bicommunal contacts and events including, inter alia, on the part of all United Nations bodies on the island, and urging the two sides to promote the active engagement of civil society and the encouragement of cooperation between economic and commercial bodies and to remove all obstacles to such contacts,</p>
					<p><em>Stressing</em> the need for the Council to pursue a rigorous, strategic approach to peacekeeping deployments,</p>
					<p><em>Welcoming</em> the intention of the Secretary-General to keep all peacekeeping operations under close review to ensure efficiency and effectiveness, including a review of UNFICYP when appropriate, and noting the importance of contingency planning in relation to the settlement, including recommendations as appropriate for further adjustments to UNFICYP’s mandate, force levels and other resources and concept of operations, taking into account developments on the ground and the views of the parties,</p>
					<p><em>Welcoming</em> also the continued efforts of Alexander Downer as the Secretary-General’s Special Adviser with a mandate to assist the parties in the conduct of fully fledged negotiations aimed at reaching a comprehensive settlement, and the efforts of Lisa Buttenheim as the Secretary-General’s Special Representative,</p>
					<p><em>Echoing</em> the Secretary-General&rsquo;s gratitude to the Government of Cyprus and the Government of Greece for their voluntary contributions to the funding of UNFICYP, and his request for further voluntary contributions from other countries and organizations, and expressing appreciation to Member States that contribute personnel to UNFICYP,</p>
					<p><em>Welcoming and encouraging</em> efforts by the United Nations to sensitize peacekeeping personnel in the prevention and control of HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases in all its peacekeeping operations,</p>

					<li><em>Reaffirms</em> all its relevant resolutions on Cyprus, in particular resolution 1251 (1999) of 29 June 1999 and subsequent resolutions;</li>
					<li><em>Expresses</em> its full support for UNFICYP and decides to extend its mandate for a further period ending 31 July 2014;</li>
					<li><em>Calls</em> on both sides to continue to engage, as a matter of urgency and while respecting UNFICYP&rsquo;s mandate, in consultations with UNFICYP on the demarcation of the buffer zone, and on the United Nations 1989 aide-memoire, with a view to reaching early agreement on outstanding issues;</li>
					<li><em>Calls</em> on the Turkish Cypriot side and Turkish forces to restore in Strovilia the military status quo which existed there prior to 30 June 2000;</li>
					<li><em>Calls</em> on both sides to allow access to deminers and to facilitate the removal of the remaining mines in Cyprus within the buffer zone, and urges both sides to extend demining operations outside the buffer zone;</li>

					<li><em>Welcomes</em> the efforts being undertaken by UNFICYP to implement the Secretary-General&rsquo;s zero tolerance policy on sexual exploitation and abuse and to ensure full compliance of its personnel with the United Nations code of conduct, requests the Secretary-General to continue to take all necessary action in this regard and to keep the Security Council informed, and urges troop-contributing countries to take appropriate preventive action including the conduct of pre-deployment awareness training, and to take disciplinary action and other action to ensure full accountability in cases of such conduct involving their personnel;</li>
					<li><em>Decides</em> to remain seized of the matter.</li>
