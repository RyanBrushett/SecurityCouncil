# IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
## (Ver2.0) //DRAFT

### Overview
More to come.

### Process
Group 5’s iteration 2 plan involves fortifying the foundation we’ve already built, fully implementing the proof-of-concept features we implemented in iteration 1, and preparing to build on top of this with administrator reporting and insights, more polished design, and more robust debate functionality in future versions.

### Tasks
The group reviewed our successes and failures in Iteration 1 and outlined the following imperative components for development in version 2.0:
	- Implementing a full database layer and refining the user/administrator/Council model with these APIs
	- Refining the simulation room model
	- Developing the nation teams model (fully implementing different team selection mechanisms and enabling users to select their own ambassadors with different methods)
	- Refining the resolution model with extended support for amendments
	- Refining the communication channels model, enabling private chat between participants and nations
	- Refining the user experience: simplifying and building consistency across pages
	- Developing the agenda model, allowing the agenda to be built and modified by the participants
