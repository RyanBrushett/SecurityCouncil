# Testing the Application

### Initial Set up:

1. The first thing you'll want to do is log in as moderator using the password Education--01 (that's two dashes)
2. From here, initial set up of the application must be complete. You'll likely want to create a new moderator account so that THE moderator account does not get used a whole lot.
    - A good idea is to create a new moderator for each simulation, though this is not strictly required.
    - The 'initial' moderator account CAN be used but is generally discouraged. A 'named' moderator account is more meaningful for end users.
3. At this point you'll want to log in as your new moderator. From here you should create a new simulation!
4. Once you're logged in, click on "Create a New Simulation". Fill out the options accordingly.
5. Once you're happy with that and have submitted the new simulation, you're ready to tell your users to sign up.

### User Sign Up:

1. A user hits the login page and does not have an account. They must fill out the registration form.
2. Note that if the passwords don't match OR if they select the same team more than once as their preference, they'll be warned and asked to redo the form.
3. Once the user account is created, they'll automatically be logged in and they can see simulations they are not a member of.
4. The user will select the simulation and, from the simulation page, be given the option to join the simulation.
   *NOTE* that upon joining the user will be assigned to their team using a weighted algorithm to determine what team to assign them to. See TechnicalNotes.md for details.
5. This process repeats for each user.

### Assigning a chairperson:

1. Once a few or all of your users have signed up, you should consider appointing a chair.
    *NOTE* that appointing a chair will remove this person from the team they've been assigned.
2. To appoint a chair, log in to your personal moderation account.
3. Select the simulation you've created.
4. You'll see a dropdown box with a list of usernames. Select a username and click Set Chairperson.

### OPTIONAL: Appointing Ambassadors:

1. If you wish, you can go into a/each team and assign an ambassador.
    *NOTE* that majority rules and the teams can elect their own ambassador.
2. You can also just wait and allow them to elect their own.
3. To appoint ambassadors yourself, starting by logging into the system as your personal moderator account.
4. Select the simulation you're currently managing.
5. Scroll to the teams and select the team to which you'd like to appoint an ambassador.
6. You'll see a dropdown with the members of the team listed.
7. Select a user and click "Set Ambassador"
