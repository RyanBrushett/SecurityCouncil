# Testing the Application
=========================

## Initial Set up:

1. The first thing you'll want to do is log in as moderator using the password Education--01 (that's two dashes)
2. From here, initial set up of the application must be complete. You'll likely want to create a new moderator account so that THE moderator account does not get used a whole lot.
    - A good idea is to create a new moderator for each simulation, though this is not strictly required.
    - The 'initial' moderator account CAN be used but is generally discouraged. A 'named' moderator account is more meaningful for end users.
3. At this point you'll want to log in as your new moderator. From here you should create a new simulation!
