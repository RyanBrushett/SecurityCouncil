# Using the Application

- - -

## General Stuff

### Initial Set up:

1. The first thing you'll want to do is log in as moderator using the password Education--01 (that's two dashes)
2. From here, initial set up of the application must be complete. You'll likely want to create a new moderator account so that THE moderator account does not get used a whole lot.
    - A good idea is to create a new moderator for each simulation, though this is not strictly required.
    - The 'initial' moderator account CAN be used but is generally discouraged. A 'named' moderator account is more meaningful for end users.
3. At this point you'll want to log in as your new moderator. From here you should create a new simulation!
4. Once you're logged in, click on "Create a New Simulation". Fill out the options accordingly.
5. Once you're happy with that and have submitted the new simulation, you're ready to tell your users to sign up.

### User Sign Up:

1. A user hits the login page and does not have an account. They must fill out the registration form.
2. Note that if the passwords don't match OR if they select the same team more than once as their preference, they'll be warned and asked to redo the form.
3. Once the user account is created, they'll automatically be logged in and they can see simulations they are not a member of.
4. The user will select the simulation and, from the simulation page, be given the option to join the simulation.
   *NOTE* that upon joining the user will be assigned to their team using a weighted algorithm to determine what team to assign them to. See TechnicalNotes.md for details.
5. This process repeats for each user.

### Assigning a chairperson:

1. Once a few or all of your users have signed up, you should consider appointing a chair.
    *NOTE* that appointing a chair will remove this person from the team they've been assigned.
2. To appoint a chair, log in to your personal moderation account.
3. Select the simulation you've created.
4. You'll see a dropdown box with a list of usernames. Select a username and click Set Chairperson.

### OPTIONAL: Appointing Ambassadors:

1. If you wish, you can go into a/each team and assign an ambassador.
    *NOTE* that majority rules and the teams can elect their own ambassador.
2. You can also just wait and allow them to elect their own.
3. To appoint ambassadors yourself, starting by logging into the system as your personal moderator account.
4. Select the simulation you're currently managing.
5. Scroll to the teams and select the team to which you'd like to appoint an ambassador.
6. You'll see a dropdown with the members of the team listed.
7. Select a user and click "Set Ambassador"

### Debate Begins

1. Technically, as soon as a user joins the simulation, they can access the debate screen. However, only Ambassadors can talk in the main channel.
2. The debate is joined by logging in as a user, navigating to a simulation in which you are registered, and clicking the "Debate" button.
3. Once in the debate screen, users can see the resolution, create communication channels (more on this in a second), and (if they are an ambassador) begin discussion.
4. There is no character limit on comments!
5. If a user wants to check for new comments, they can reload the debate using the reload button.

### Creating Communication Channels

1. A user can open a new communication channel with a subset of the members of the simulation by clicking the "Create New Channel" button.
2. A window will pop up and users can select from the list the people (or countries) they'd like to have added. Be sure to name the channel in the bar at the top!
    *NOTE* that adding a whole country adds all of the team members from that country.
3. Once the chanel is created, it can be accessed on the left side of the debate view. Comment as normal!
4. You can also embed youtube videos to represet events (as the moderator) or if you film yourself making a video submission.
    *NOTE* on embedded youtube links. Please be sure to copy the EMBED link. That is, on the video page, click on share, followed by embed, and copy the link which should look something like this:

## Being An Ambassador

### You've Been Appointed Or Elected! What now?

1. Being the ambassador means you're the voice of your team. You'll have access to putting forward motions and uploading position papers. You'll also be the member of the team who can comment in the caucus communication channel.
2. Assuming you're logged in as the ambassador, select your country from the list of countries in the simulation landing page.
3. In the country screen, you'll notice the sections for position papers and forwarding motions.

### Forwarding a Motion

1. From the country page, type the motion you'd like to forward in the box and click "Forward Motion".
    *NOTE* that we purposely left this general / flexible so that you could motion to do anything. For example, you can say "We motion to ammend ... " or "We motion to challenge the chair ... " and so on - anything goes.
    *NOTE* that we are confident this approach is viable because of the slight moderation ability posessed by the chair. E.g. the chair can select which motions are sent for debate and which ones are to silly to see and are trashed.
    *NOTE* that ALL motions are recorded by the system so repeated deleted motions may indicate an issue with group understanding or level of seriousness. 
2. The page will reload meaning the motion has been sent. It is now in the hands of the chair.

### Uploading a Position Paper

1. From the country page described above, notice the Postion Paper box. There are two ways to use this box:
2. To upload a plain-text position paper, simply type out or copy-and-paste the position paper into the box and click submit. You do not have to upload a file with the paper. The most recent submission is kept so feel free to update it!
3. To upload a .doc or .pdf (or .md or .txt so on and so forth) position paper, simply type a summary of the paper in the box (even just a few lines) and select the file using the upload button. The file will be uploaded to the server and the moderator will be able to download the file. Again, most recent submission counts.

### Debate on Behalf of Your Country

1. When logged in as a moderator, enter the debate screen by clicking "Debate" in the nav bar.
2. You'll notice that you now how permission to comment on the caucus channel. This is the debate view and should only be used for serious conversation about motions / the resolution / etc.
3. When a vote is called, the comment box will be removed and replace with the voting interface. Be sure to cast your vote! You won't be able to vote a second time so make sure to talk to your team about it before hand.
    *NOTE* that just like in real life, you can't undo a vote. Be sure!
4. Your options are Yay, Nay, or Not Present (meaning you left the room and refused to vote).
    *NOTE* that quorum requires a certain number of present ambassadors for a vote to be considered valid. If quorum is not met, debate will be resumed on the motion/resolution and the vote will have failed.
    *NOTE* on veto: Veto only applies on the resolution and is automatic. If one of the permanent members votes "no" on a resolution vote, the resolution is vetoed and does not pass. Debate does not resume and there are no more votes.

## Being The Chair

### You've Been Appointed. What now?

1. Being the chair means you've been removed from your team _temporarily_ for however long you're the chair.
2. You have been given some extra responsibility in place!
    - You have a separate chair-only page to conduct official chair business.
    - Your comments are special in the debate view (and are auto-generated).
3. You are responsible for managing the flow of debate. When motions are put forward, it is up to you to receive and sort them.
4. You will select what goes up for debate next, when motions are brought to a vote (or responding to a motion to vote) etc.

### Accessing the Chair Page

1. Once logged in, navigate to the simulation in which you are the chairperson.
2. You'll see a button enabled at the top of the page called "Chair". Click that!
3. From the chair screen, you'll see a list of motions (if there are any!) and the resolution.
    - The buttons control the flow of debate/voting. You can also trash garbage motions, for example if a team forwards something blatantly silly.
    - Be careful with that trash button! There is no undo.
    *NOTE* to moderators: Motion metrics are tracked. We feel it's safe to assume deleted motions are redundant or silly and this is noted by team in the metrics page.
4. When a motion has received enough debate, you'll be able to put it to a vote. This is left purposely vague and up to the chair as debate should flow organically.

### Once You Click Vote

1. When Vote is clicked, a notification is automatically generated on your behalf in the debate view and the main channel changes. Rather than commenting, users will be presented with the option to vote.
2. When enough votes are put through, the result will be indicated and the chair page will change again slightly. Debate will default back to the resolution itself.
    *NOTE* that th resolution will have to be manually updated to reflect the change forwarded by the motion. This, again, was left vague and general to allow motions to be organic.
3. Only one motion can be debated at a time and, of course, voted upon at a time.

## Moderating

### Accessing Country Info and Setting Directives

1. When logged in as a moderator, you'll be able to select each country and set directives for that country which they'll see privately. You'll also be able to download their position papers.
2. From within the simulation, select a country. Note the box regarding Country Directives.
3. You can type out some notes and click Set Directives. As mentioned, the team will be the only ones to see these.
4. From the same view, you can also view / download the position papers for that team.

### Setting Position Papers as Visible to Other Teams

1. To make things interesting, you can set position papers as visible to other teams.
2. When logged in as the moderator, from the simulation screen, there is a dropdown you can select as Hidden or Visible under "Set the visibility of member's position paper"
3. When set to hidden, other teams will NOT be able to see someone's position paper. They will only see their own.
4. When set to visible, other teams can see the position papers that others have uploaded.

###  Editing The Resolution (as needed)

1. From the simulation screen, the resolution is editable at the right side of the screen.
2. Click Set Resolution when ready!
    *NOTE* that there is no undo here. Be sure!
    
### Joining the Debate and Communicating With Others

1. From the simulation screen, the debate can be accessed by clicking the orange debate status link to the right of every page.
2. Once in the debate, you can see *ALL* of the communication going on between members and comment in them yourself. Simply select the channel you'd like to view on the left and the centre will change to reflect that channel.
    *NOTE* that we felt this was extremely important not only for evaluating discussion but also for controlling anything inappropriate. The comments are permanent and can be accessed by the moderator even if the channel is deleted by the user.
3. You can also post as moderator and embed youtube events using the Embed link for those videos:
    *NOTE* on embedded youtube links. Please be sure to copy the EMBED link. That is, on the video page, click on share, followed by embed, and copy the link which should look something like this:
    
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/tjvfgPyRDa4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Reporting / Metrics

1. You can access some reports regarding the status of the simulation and the activity so far by clicking the "Reports" link in the nav bar from within the simulation.
2. These are broken down by User, Team, Motions, or just a general overview. Be sure to scroll! At times these tables can get large.
3. Note that on top of reports and metrics, you can visit the debate at any point by clicking the debate status box (the orange box) on the right of every screen. From here you'll be able to enter communication channels and see the discussion first-hand.
