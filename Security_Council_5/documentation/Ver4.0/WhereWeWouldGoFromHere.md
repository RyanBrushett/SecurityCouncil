# The Future of This Project
============================

## If We Were To Continue / Had Unlimited Time:

1. We'd certainly like to do a full QAT cycle. This would include
    - Test functions
    - More complete and thorough test runs without the client.
    - Test runs with the client to collect bug / ux / enhancement suggestions.
2. More complete security.
    - Hashed and salted passwords.
    - Secure the routes a little further to prevent cross-contamination of users w/ moderators, etc.
3. More ability to moderate.
    - Have the moderator be able to remove users from channels.
    - Fully delete simulation spaces to minimize DB footprint.
    - Control more closely the teams, number of members, etc.
