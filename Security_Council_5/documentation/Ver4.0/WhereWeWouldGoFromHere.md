# The Future of This Project

## If We Were To Continue / Had Unlimited Time:

1. We'd certainly like to do a full QAT cycle. This would include
    - Test functions/scripts
    - More complete and thorough test runs before delivery to the client
    - Test runs with the client to collect bug / ux / enhancement suggestions
2. More complete security
    - Hashed and salted passwords
    - Secure the routes a little further to prevent cross-contamination of users w/ moderators, etc.
3. More ability to moderate
    - Have the moderator be able to remove users from channels and simulations.
    - Fully delete simulation spaces to minimize DB footprint
    - Control more closely the teams, number of members, etc.
    - Undos for various things (like appointing a chair, deleting a motion, etc.)
4. More elaborate metrics
    - More detail for all measurables
    - Visualizations
    - A way of quantifying the 'quality' of a comment (maybe through up-voting?)
5. Notifications of some sorts to users / mods / chairs
    - For example, when a vote is finished, a new comment is posted, a vote begins, etc.
    - Also when someone opens or updates a communicaton channel with you
