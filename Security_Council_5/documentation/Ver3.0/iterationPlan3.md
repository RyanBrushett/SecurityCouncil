## Iteration Plan, Iteration 3

### Tasks for Moderators:
- Mods need to be able to receive motions once the vote has completed.

### Tasks for Chairs:
- Chair needs to be able to receive a motion and action it

    - Button to enable the voting mechanic on the particular amendment
    - Able to trash 'garbage'/joke motions
    - Only be able to debate one motion at a time.
- Upon the chair actioning a motion in any way aside from deletion, the debate channel should be sent an alert regarding the action.

### Tasks for participants
- Participants should be able to elect ambassadors on their team.
- Participants should be able to upload .doc, .pdf, and other common files to the server as position papers
    - Users should be encouraged to include a plaintext summary in the text box upon upload.
    - Option to use purely plaintext exists.
- Ambassadors should be able to forward a motion. This could be an amendment, an action, a vote, etc.
    - This is restricted only to ambassadors.
- Communication channels should be able to be opened with other countries / participants at will using an easy tagging/country naming convention.
- Users should be able to embed youtube videos in the communication channels.
